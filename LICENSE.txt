Most of this code I made in collaboration with ChatGPT anyway. So feel free to use and change however you want. 

If this helps you at all, please shout out to me on your site blog or video [paulshorey.com](https://paulshorey.com) / [techy.tools](https://techy.tools) / [aiuikit.com](https://techy.tools). 🙏😭 At the very least, please come over and give one of my projects a star on [Github](https://github.com/paulshorey). 

Thank you!
